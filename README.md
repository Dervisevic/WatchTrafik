WatchTrafik
===========

This is a pebble.js based application. It's built on top of the [v√§sttrafik API](http://labs.vasttrafik.se/For-utvecklare/APIer/?clubId=2). Watchtrafik uses GPS geolocation data and send that to the API. The app then shows relevant stops close to the user (max 3000m area). The user now chooses the appropriate stop and all departures are shown along with their departure time, minutes to departure and letter of the substop. 

This is still in development, well maybe not active but there are issues that need to be worked out befoe it could be released on the pebble store. Please check [issues](https://github.com/Dervisevic/WatchTrafik/issues) to the right.
